# runtime-env-react-docker

Small project to learn how to configure a create react app application at runtime to be able to buid with Docker once and deploy in any environment without changing the code, only the env variables that are passed to the app.

Inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-runtime-environment-variables-with-create-react-app-docker-and-nginx-7f9d42a91d70/)
